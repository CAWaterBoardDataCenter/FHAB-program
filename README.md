# FHAB-program

The FHAB program was developed starting in 2014. SWAMP prepared the California Freshwater HAB Assessment and Support Strategy to articulate the goals of the program to provide response, assessment, and communication to statewide occurrences of HABs. Since that time, the program has developed systems and infrastructure for sampling and tracking bloom events, created informational resources for agency staff and the public, and collaborated with partner entities to establish voluntary guidance thresholds for public health postings in recreational waterbodies.
